Workaround is known. Grahame said "this is an error in the base r4 spec, and the only way to resolve it is for you to manually specify a minimum of 1 for .code.coding" Note that the same is true of R4 and R4B. Current using-fhir-core-profiles branch does build clean.

Now that the IG publisher forces any observation that is a profiled vital sign to be compliant with the FHIR core profiles, I try to create a profile on BP and Weight but get errors.

Note that the error only appear if your profile is not consistant with the profiles declared in FHIR core. (See raw-profiles below where I define BP differently)

# testVitals

Main branch is using us-core and not showing any errors
- ci-build - http://build.fhir.org/ig/JohnMoehrke/testMed/branches/main/index.html

using-fhir-core-profiles is using fhir core profiles and getting errors on BP. Would also get them on height and weight. Does not throw errors on vitals.
- ci-build - https://build.fhir.org/ig/JohnMoehrke/testVital/branches/using-fhir-core-profiles/index.html

using-no-profiles is just examples that are compatible with FHIR core profiles, but are not declaring FHIR core profiles. No errors or warnings
- ci-build - https://build.fhir.org/ig/JohnMoehrke/testVital/branches/using-no-profiles/

raw-profiles is not using us-core or fhir core profiles, but defining profiles on BP and Height. These do not have a problem if they define exactly the same requirements as FHIR core profiles. But they can't deviate. If you define a BP and don't use the .code that the FHIR core profile uses, then an error will be thrown.
